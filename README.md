# Covariance Estimator CV-Selector

Materials for an investigation in developing a cross-validated covariance
estimator selector. The repository is organized as follows

- `manuscript`: paper describing the approach
- `analysis`: materials for data analysis examples
- `simulations`: materials for simulation studies
